# TechTips.fun — TODO

## ⚠️ PITFALLS — mistakes already paid for, DO NOT regress these
- [ ] **No-slash `/blog/<slug>` links 307-redirect.** The Worker serves directory-style URLs; `/blog/x` answers with `307 → /blog/x/`. 21 such links across 5 published Windows 11 articles were fixed 2026-10-04. **Guard:** `schedule-posts.yml` runs a `sed` normaliser on every staged article at publish time — do NOT remove that step, and keep writing new cross-links WITH the trailing slash.
- [ ] **`GITHUB_TOKEN` pushes do NOT trigger other workflows.** The scheduler's publish commit uses the automatic token, so `linkedin-share.yml` never fires on scheduled publishes (first run 2026-10-04 published the post with NO teaser). **Guard:** `schedule-posts.yml` posts the teaser itself in the "Share the new post to LinkedIn" step right after pushing — do NOT delete it expecting the push event to cover it. `linkedin-share.yml` stays for manual dispatch (`gh workflow run "Share new posts to LinkedIn" --repo saonbd1/astro-blog-starter-template --ref main -f slug=<slug>`) and ordinary (PAT/user) pushes.
- [ ] **`/v2/ugcPosts` rejects person URNs on Company-Page apps (422).** Posting must go through the legacy `/v2/shares` endpoint with `owner: urn:li:person:{openid sub}` (sub resolved live from `/v2/userinfo`) and the `w_member_social` scope. Don't "upgrade" `scripts/share-to-linkedin.mjs` to ugcPosts without testing.
- [ ] **GitHub Actions cron drifts.** The 09:00 UTC cron has been landing ~14:00–15:30 UTC in run history. GitHub scheduled triggers are not exact; if a precise publish time ever matters, don't rely on Actions cron — use a Cloudflare cron trigger or a PAT-based scheduler.
- [ ] **Signed CDN URLs expire.** The manuscdn screenshots in the Netlify-vs-Vercel article expired 2026-12-01; they were localised to `public/article-media/` before expiry. Always download-and-rewrite signed screenshots at STAGING time, never at publish time.
- [ ] **WAF 403s from datacenter IPs are false positives.** `www.w3.org` answers 403 to curl/Node/datacenter fingerprints but serves the real page to browsers — verified 2026-10-04 (the ARIA disclosure-navigation example link is alive; fetched full 52KB page content). `check-links.mjs` therefore sends a browser UA + `Accept-Language` and reports 401/403 as `blocked` (human-review), NOT `broken`. Never delete a "403" link from an article without opening it in a browser first.
- [ ] **Google locale hops are scanner artifacts.** `developers.google.com` 302-appends `?hl=<geo-locale>` (datacenter IP geolocated to India → `?hl=hi`) when the client sends no `Accept-Language` header. The checker now sends `Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9` — if you strip that header, expect the phantom 302s to return.
- [ ] **Google Console links are login-walled by design.** `console.cloud.google.com` 302s to the Google sign-in page, or 302-loops to itself when unauthenticated. Expected for signed-in readers — the checker reports these as `login_wall`, never `dead`/`broken`.
- [ ] **Prefer final canonical URLs over redirectors.** Microsoft's `/en-us/help/12440` short link 301-hops twice before landing on `/en-us/windows/activation/activate-windows`; articles now link the destination directly (same for `linkedin.com/developers/` → `developer.linkedin.com/`). Fewer hops = fewer failure points.
- [ ] **Reels: never put a `→` (U+2192) in a scene.** It is outside the loaded latin font subset, and Chromium's font fallback kills the renderer (`Protocol error ... Target closed`) in a fontless container. The outro arrow is inline SVG on purpose — keep it that way. `reels/scripts/glyph-audit.mjs` warns about any other risky glyph at build time.
- [ ] **Reels: `/dev/shm` under ~512 MB breaks Chrome mid-render.** Remotion keeps ~8 MB per concurrent tab; `reels/scripts/render-reel.mjs` auto-switches to `REMOTION_SHARED_MEMORY_BACKEND=file`. Do not remove that fallback, and don't raise `--concurrency` blindly on small-shm hosts.

## Automate LinkedIn cross-posting (short version + link)
- [x] Manually shared today's article teaser via the connected LinkedIn session (2026-10-04)
- [ ] Next scheduled post should go out automatically via the workflow chain below (target: next `pending-posts/` publish)
- [x] `scripts/share-to-linkedin.mjs` — builds a teaser (title + truncated frontmatter `description`) with the article link + OG thumbnail and posts via the LinkedIn legacy `/v2/shares` API (owner URN = OpenID `sub`); supports `<slug>`, `--latest`, `--dry-run`
- [x] `.github/workflows/linkedin-share.yml` — auto-fires when a new post is added to `src/content/blog/` (so the scheduled-publish workflow triggers it) + manual dispatch by slug
- [x] Create a LinkedIn developer app with the "Share on LinkedIn" AND "Sign In with LinkedIn" products and get an OAuth token with the `openid profile w_member_social` scopes (done 2026-10-04; token expires ~2026-12-04)
- [x] Store the token locally — `~\.linkedin-credential.xml` (DPAPI-encrypted), auto-loaded into `$env:LINKEDIN_TOKEN` by PowerShell profiles
- [x] Add the token as the GitHub repository secret `LINKEDIN_TOKEN` on saonbd1/astro-blog-starter-template (set via `gh secret set`, confirmed in `gh secret list`)
- [x] Verify the token with one real test post (done 2026-10-04: published the ToC article teaser, activity `urn:li:activity:7512385216968028160`). Key finding: `/v2/ugcPosts` rejects `urn:li:person` URNs for apps created under a Company Page (422: author must match `urn:li:company:`|`urn:li:member:`), and member URNs need the legacy numeric member ID which OpenID no longer exposes — so we post via the legacy `/v2/shares` endpoint, which accepts `urn:li:person:{openid-sub}` with `w_member_social`
- [ ] Test end-to-end: the 2026-10-05 09:00 UTC run is the true test of the in-workflow teaser (publish + teaser in one run). The missed oauth-article teaser was back-filled 2026-10-04 via workflow_dispatch (activity `urn:li:activity:7512539720460124160`). After the run, check `gh run list --repo saonbd1/astro-blog-starter-template` — both the publish and the "Share the new post to LinkedIn" step must succeed.
- [ ] Optional: make re-runs idempotent (e.g., a `.shared` marker per slug) so re-pushes don't double-post (low risk: GITHUB_TOKEN pushes don't trigger workflows, so the scheduler's own push can't re-fire linkedin-share.yml)
- [x] 60s "Wait for the Cloudflare deploy" step added to `schedule-posts.yml` before the in-workflow LinkedIn step (done 2026-10-04) so the teaser's link is usually live when it posts. Deploys still take ~1–2 min, so very early clicks can still 404 briefly — unavoidable with Git-based deploys.
- [x] Rotate the LinkedIn client secret after it appeared in chat (done 2026-10-04: regenerated in the Developer Portal, old secret invalidated; new value stored as GitHub secret `LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET` via `gh secret set --repo`; access token `LINKEDIN_TOKEN` unaffected — client-secret rotation does not invalidate existing tokens, so posting continues to ~2026-12-04; the secret is only needed for the OAuth token exchange at the next re-authorization)
- [ ] Renew the LinkedIn access token before it expires (~2026-12-04, 60-day member token): re-run the OAuth flow using the stored client secret (`gh secret get LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET --repo saonbd1/astro-blog-starter-template` — never paste plaintext), then update both stores: `gh secret set LINKEDIN_TOKEN --repo saonbd1/astro-blog-starter-template` (used by the GitHub Actions workflows) and the local DPAPI file `~\.linkedin-credential.xml` (auto-loads into `$env:LINKEDIN_TOKEN`). Flow documented in `pending-posts/how-to-set-up-linkedin-oauth-client.md`
- [x] Fix internal `/blog/<slug>` links missing the trailing slash (done 2026-10-04: 21 links across 5 published Windows 11 articles — the Worker answers the no-slash form with a 307 redirect to the directory URL). `schedule-posts.yml` now normalises `/blog/` links in every staged article at publish time, so future scheduled posts ship with the slash.

## Social / SEO
- [ ] Re-scrape https://www.techtips.fun/blog/migrate-static-html-site-to-astro/ in the LinkedIn Post Inspector — the preview was cached before the OG image fix (OG tags verified correct on 2026-10-04)
- [ ] Add `socialImage` to the zod schema in `src/content.config.ts` (currently hardcoded as `/og/{slug}.png` in `src/pages/blog/[...slug].astro`; unknown keys are stripped by the schema)

## Articles & identity (2026-10-04)
- [x] 3 LinkedIn articles staged in `pending-posts/` (merged from 3 thin drafts): the expanded automation guide + a new LinkedIn OAuth client setup article (sibling to the Google OAuth for Blogger post, published a day earlier so the automation guide can link to it) + a Netlify vs Vercel email-experience comparison (4 signed manuscdn screenshot URLs downloaded locally before their 2026-12-01 expiry and rewritten to `public/article-media/`)
- [x] Branded OG cards for all 3 staged posts generated with the repo's own `npm run generate:assets` (placeholder hero fallback, author portrait)
- [x] `kamrul-digital-expert` identity skill saved to `C:\Users\saonb\.cline\skills\kamrul-digital-expert\` (SKILL.md + references/bio.md) — recovered from a corrupt zip, broken paths fixed, voice rules + length-verified platform templates added, bio de-exaggerated (stats verified via live API: Astro 63,031★ / n8n 206,599★)
- [ ] Optional: append author byline (E-E-A-T) to the 3 staged posts — draft ready, awaiting approval

## daily.dev
- [x] Installed `daily.dev` + `daily-dev-ask` agent skills and stored the API token (2026-10-04)
- [ ] Note: the daily.dev public API is read-only for content — sharing your own articles there is done via the Share button in the daily.dev extension/web app, not the API

## Maintenance
- [ ] Update skills later via `cd C:\Users\saonb\daily && git pull`, then re-copy the skill folders


## Reels (Remotion) — article → vertical video
- [x] `reels/` — standalone Remotion project that turns any `src/content/blog` article into a 1080x1920 reel: title hook → key points → Code Hike animated code → outro CTA, with TikTok-style word-by-word captions. Details + pitfalls in `reels/README.md`.
- [x] `cd reels && npm run reel -- --latest` renders `reels/out/<slug>.mp4`; `npm run reel:all` renders every article; `npm run dev` opens Remotion Studio; `npm run still -- --slug <slug> --frame 210` renders a poster PNG.
- [ ] Optional next: real voiceover, transcribed with Whisper, so the captions (and the reel length) come from audio instead of the synthesised timing track.
- [ ] Optional next: render on Remotion Lambda instead of locally for volume.
