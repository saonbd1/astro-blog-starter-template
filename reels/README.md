# TechTips.fun — Article → Reel generator

Turns a Markdown article from `../src/content/blog` into a **vertical 1080x1920
reel** (MP4) built with [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/):

- **Animated code** via [Code Hike](https://codehike.org/) — snippets fade/morph in
  with real token transitions, syntax-highlighted from the article's fenced blocks.
- **TikTok-style captions** — 3-4 words at a time, with the current word highlighted
  in brand lime.
- **Branded scenes** — title hook → key points → code → outro CTA, styled with the
  same palette as the site's OG cards.

Everything is driven by the article's own Markdown, so there is no second source of
truth: edit the post, re-render, done.

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18+** (this repo targets 22+). Uses `fs.statfsSync`, so Node < 18.15 won't work.
- Network access on first run (Google Fonts + Remotion's Chrome Headless Shell download).

```bash
cd reels
npm install
```

## Quick start

```bash
npm run props -- --list                       # every article slug
npm run props -- --latest                     # build props for the newest post
npm run reel  -- --latest                     # render out/<slug>.mp4
npm run reel  -- --slug 10-linux-terminal-commands-i-use-every
npm run reel:all                              # render every article
npm run still -- --slug <slug> --frame 210    # a single PNG poster
npm run dev                                   # Remotion Studio (live preview)
```

`npm run reel` always rebuilds the props from Markdown first, so one command is
enough. Output lands in `out/`.

To render just a few seconds (handy for a teaser or a quick preview):

```bash
npm run reel -- --slug <slug> --from 0 --duration 8 --out demos/teaser.mp4
```

`demos/8s-demo-linux-terminal.mp4` is an 8-second example produced that way.

### Options

| Flag | Applies to | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--slug <slug>` | props, reel | Which article |
| `--latest` | props, reel | Newest by `pubDate` |
| `--all` | props, reel | Every article |
| `--list` | props | Print slugs |
| `--theme <name>` | props, reel | Code Hike theme (default `github-dark`) |
| `--still` | reel | Render a PNG instead of MP4 |
| `--frame <n>` | reel | Frame for `--still` |
| `--out <path>` | reel | Explicit output path |
| `--from <sec>` | reel | Start the clip at this offset |
| `--duration <sec>` | reel | Render only this many seconds (e.g. a teaser) |
| `--concurrency <n>` | reel | Parallel render tabs |

## How it works

```
src/content/blog/<slug>.md
        |
        |  scripts/build-reel-props.mjs   (Node)
        |    - parse frontmatter + ## sections + fenced code
        |    - plan scenes and their durations
        |    - highlight code with Code Hike (@code-hike/lighter)
        |    - synthesise a word-level caption track
        v
src/generated/<slug>.json  (fully-baked props)  ->  also written to latest.json
        |
        |  npx remotion render Reel out/<slug>.mp4 --props=...
        v
out/<slug>.mp4   (1080x1920, 30fps, H.264)
```

Highlighting happens in **Node, at build time**, so the composition is a pure
function of its props - no filesystem or network reads while rendering, and the
same props file always produces the same video.

### File map

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/build-reel-props.mjs` | Article → props (parsing, scenes, captions, highlighting) |
| `scripts/render-reel.mjs` | Build props + call the Remotion CLI |
| `scripts/glyph-audit.mjs` | Warns about glyphs that can crash the renderer |
| `src/Root.tsx` | Registers the `Reel` composition |
| `src/Reel.tsx` | Scene timeline, background, top bar, captions, progress bar |
| `src/scenes/*` | Title / point / code / outro scenes |
| `src/code/*` | Code Hike token-transition animation |
| `src/captions/CaptionOverlay.tsx` | TikTok-style pagination + word highlight |
| `src/schema.ts` | Props contract (zod, also powers the Studio props editor) |
| `src/brand.ts` | Brand tokens, reel size, safe area |

## Customising

- **Brand / sizes** — `src/brand.ts` (`BRAND`, `REEL`, `SAFE_AREA`).
- **Pacing** — the `*_FRAMES` constants at the top of `build-reel-props.mjs`
  (`TITLE_FRAMES`, `POINT_FRAMES`, `CODE_STEP_FRAMES`, `OUTRO_FRAMES`), plus
  `MAX_SECTIONS` / `MAX_TOTAL_FRAMES` to cap reel length.
- **Caption cadence** — `COMBINE_TOKENS_WITHIN_MS` in `src/captions/CaptionOverlay.tsx`
  (lower = fewer words on screen at once).
- **Code look** — `src/fonts.ts` (`codeFontSize`, `codeTabSize`) and the theme
  passed to the builder. The font size auto-shrinks to fit the longest line.
- **Scene selection** — `buildScenes()` decides which sections become code scenes
  vs. text scenes. Sections with fenced code become code scenes.

Sections whose code fence has no language are highlighted as plain text; snippets
are capped at `MAX_CODE_LINES` lines each.

## Adding a voiceover (optional)

Captions are currently *synthesised* from the on-screen script with even timings,
which is why the reel works without audio. To drive them from real speech instead:

1. Generate a voiceover and drop it in `public/` as `<slug>.mp3`.
2. Transcribe it with `@remotion/install-whisper-cpp` + `@remotion/captions`
   (see the official [`--tiktok` template](https://www.remotion.dev/templates/tiktok))
   into `public/<slug>.json`.
3. Swap the `captions` array in `build-reel-props.mjs` for that transcription and
   add the audio with `<Audio src={staticFile(...)} />` in `src/Reel.tsx`.

The `CaptionPage` component already consumes word-level `fromMs`/`toMs` timings,
so nothing else has to change.

## Rendering in bulk / CI

`npm run reel:all` renders every article sequentially. For serious volume, render
on [Remotion Lambda](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/lambda) or your own workers -
the props files are the only input you need to ship.

### Running headless on Linux

Rendering needs Chromium plus its system libraries. Two environment notes worth
knowing, both discovered the hard way while building this:

1. **Missing shared libraries.** Chrome Headless Shell needs `libnss3` / `libnspr4`.
   On a normal box install `libnss3 libnspr4` (or run Remotion's `apt-get` block
   from the docs). Without root you can fetch the `.deb`s, extract them and point
   `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` at them:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p /tmp/chromedeps && cd /tmp/chromedeps
   curl -sO https://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/n/nss/libnss3_3.87.1-1+deb12u2_amd64.deb
   curl -sO https://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/n/nspr/libnspr4_4.35-1_amd64.deb
   for d in *.deb; do dpkg-deb -x "$d" ./root; done
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PWD/root/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
   ```

2. **Tiny `/dev/shm`.** Remotion keeps an ~8 MB shared-memory pool per concurrent
   tab. Containers often mount only 64 MB of `/dev/shm`, so Chrome dies mid-render
   with `Target closed`. `scripts/render-reel.mjs` detects this and sets
   `REMOTION_SHARED_MEMORY_BACKEND=file` automatically (you can set it yourself, or
   pass `--concurrency 4`).

## Pitfalls

- **Avoid glyphs outside the loaded font subset.** We only load the `latin`
  Google Fonts subset. `\u2192` (`→`) is *not* in it, and Chromium's font fallback
  hard-crashed the renderer here (`Target closed`) until the arrow was replaced with
  inline SVG. `scripts/glyph-audit.mjs` now warns on every build; prefer ASCII or SVG
  for symbols.
- **`remotion.config.ts` is compiled to CommonJS** — `import.meta` is not available
  there. Resolve modules via `createRequire(process.cwd() + "/package.json")`.
- **`codehike`'s `<Pre />` does not apply `code.style`.** Pass the text colour
  explicitly (see `src/code/CodeTransition.tsx`) or the code renders in the default
  (black-on-dark) colour.
- **`createTikTokStyleCaptions` only breaks pages when a token starts with a
  space.** The builder prefixes every word with one, Whisper-style, and sets
  `pageBreakAfter` on the last word of each scene.
