![A generated reel scene: syntax-highlighted code in a terminal panel with word-by-word captions](/blog-to-video-pipeline.png)

Search "blog to video" and you get the same twenty products. Vidup, Revid, Fliki, Pictory, HeyGen, Descript, GhostShorts. They all promise the same thing: paste a URL, get a short. They are also all subscriptions that want you to hand your content to somebody else's server.

That is a fine trade for a marketer. It is a bad trade if you write a technical blog, because the thing that makes your posts worth reading is the thing those tools cannot render: **code**. Stock footage with an AI voiceover does not explain a `docker run` flag.

So I built the self-hosted version instead. My articles already live as Markdown in a git repo, which means a video can be *derived* from them the same way the HTML is. This post is the full pipeline, start to finish, with the numbers and the failures included, because the failures are the part nobody writes down.

## What you end up with

One MP4 per article, 1080x1920, rendered automatically when you publish:

```text
src/content/blog/<slug>.md
        |
        |  1. article -> props        (Node, ~200ms)
        |     - parse frontmatter, ## sections, fenced code
        |     - plan scenes + durations
        |     - syntax-highlight the code
        |     - synthesise a word-level caption track
        v
src/generated/<slug>.json            (fully-baked props)
        |
        |  2. props -> MP4            (Remotion, ~25-40s)
        v
article-reels/<slug>.mp4             (1080x1920, h264, 30fps)
```

The stack is smaller than it sounds:

| Piece | Job |
| --- | --- |
| [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/) | Turns React components into frames, and frames into an MP4 |
| [Code Hike](https://codehike.org/) | Syntax highlighting with animated token transitions |
| `@remotion/captions` | Groups a word-level transcript into TikTok-style pages |
| GitHub Actions | Runs the render on publish |

There is no SaaS, no queue service and no database: it is self-hosted end to end. The only moving parts are a Node script and a headless Chromium, and the expensive one - rendering - costs 25-40 seconds of CPU per reel.

## Prerequisites

- **Node 22+** (the CLI wrapper uses `fs.statfsSync`, which landed in Node 18.15)
- **A repo with Markdown posts.** Frontmatter is nice but optional, first `# H1` becomes the title if you skip it.
- **GitHub**, for the automation half.

The first `npm install` pulls Remotion, which on first render downloads Chrome Headless Shell (~100 MB). Everything after that is offline.

## Step 1 - Scaffold the Remotion project

Keep it in a subfolder so it does not fight your site's build:

```bash
npx create-video@latest --blank reels
cd reels
npm install codehike @code-hike/lighter @remotion/captions @remotion/google-fonts @remotion/layout-utils @remotion/animation-utils
```

Two templates are worth stealing from rather than writing from scratch, and I merged both:

```bash
npx create-video@latest --code-hike   # animated code snippets
npx create-video@latest --tiktok      # word-by-word captions
```

Then register one composition. Everything interesting happens in its props, not in its config:

```tsx
// src/Root.tsx
<Composition
  id="Reel"
  component={Reel}
  fps={30}
  width={1080}
  height={1920}
  defaultProps={defaultProps}
  schema={reelPropsSchema}
  calculateMetadata={calculateReelMetadata}
/>
```

`1080x1920` at `30fps` is the whole reason this is a "reel" and not a video. Portrait, vertical, and short enough to hold attention.

One warning before you go further: **`calculateMetadata` is not where you should put your data loading.** A lot of Remotion examples do the heavy lifting there, and it works, but it runs in a browser context on every render. I put all of it in a Node script instead and passed the result in as props. The composition then renders the same video from the same JSON, every time, with no filesystem or network access of its own.

## Step 2 - Turn an article into props

This is the part with the actual intellectual work in it. A blog post is prose; a reel is a sequence of 3-5 second beats. Something has to decide what survives.

Define the contract first. Every scene carries its own duration so the total is just a sum, which keeps the composition dumb and the renderer deterministic:

```js
// four scene types, that is the whole vocabulary
{ type: "title", kicker, title, subtitle, durationInFrames }
{ type: "point", kicker, heading, body,  durationInFrames }
{ type: "code",  kicker, heading, steps, durationInFrames }
{ type: "outro", heading, body, url,     durationInFrames }
```

Then parse the Markdown into `##` sections, remembering which fenced code blocks belong to which heading. Headings that *have* code become code scenes; headings with only prose become point scenes:

```js
for (const section of sections) {
  if (section.code.length) {
    scenes.push({ type: "code", heading: section.heading, steps: section.code, duration });
  } else {
    scenes.push({ type: "point", heading: section.heading, body: firstSentence(section.prose) });
  }
}
```

Three rules that took a few iterations to get right:

**Cap the reel, not the article.** Six sections and ~58 seconds maximum. A reel that tries to cover a 3,000 word post is just a fast slideshow nobody finishes.

**Trim the code.** A snippet of 40 lines is unreadable at phone size. Nine lines per step, two steps per section, and most posts end up with four or five code beats.

**Cut prose to one sentence.** Headings plus a single sentence read fine at reel speed. Paragraphs do not.

### Highlight once, in Node

The composition should not be doing syntax highlighting at render time. Do it in the props builder, so the props file contains finished `HighlightedCode` objects:

```js
import { highlight } from "codehike/code";
import { getThemeColors } from "@code-hike/lighter";

const highlighted = await highlight({ lang, meta, value: code }, theme);
const themeColors = await getThemeColors(theme);
```

Both of those work in plain Node, which was the assumption that made the whole architecture viable. Highlighting in Node also means a failed highlight fails the build loudly, instead of producing a half-rendered video twenty minutes later.

### The caption track

I did not record a voiceover, so there is no audio to transcribe. Instead the builder synthesises a **word-level** caption track: for each scene, the on-screen text is split into words, and each word gets a slice of that scene's duration, weighted by word length.

```js
const weights = words.map((w) => w.length + 3);
const totalWeight = weights.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
// each word gets (weight / totalWeight) * sceneDurationMs
```

That is fake, of course. Nothing is being spoken. But it produces a caption track with real timing that the TikTok-style grouping can consume, and it means the reel works with zero audio infrastructure. Swapping in a real transcript later is a one-file change.

## Step 3 - Build the vertical composition

The composition is a `<Series>` of scenes, with three things painted on top for the whole duration: a brand bar, the caption overlay, and a segmented progress bar.

```tsx
<Series>
  {scenes.map((scene, i) => (
    <Series.Sequence key={i} durationInFrames={scene.durationInFrames}>
      <SceneRenderer scene={scene} />
    </Series.Sequence>
  ))}
</Series>
```

### Animated code, not a screenshot of code

Code Hike's trick is that it computes a per-token diff between two snippets and exposes it as keyframes, so identifiers physically move as one snippet becomes the next. You wire it up once:

```tsx
const transitions = calculateTransitions(ref.current!, oldSnapshot);
transitions.forEach(({ element, keyframes, options }) => {
  const progress = interpolate(frame, [delay, delay + duration], [0, 1], { easing });
  applyStyle({ element, keyframes, progress, linearProgress });
});
```

Pass `oldCode={null}` for the first snippet in a scene and the code fades in from nothing. That single detail is what makes the code scenes feel like motion instead of a slide.

### Captions that highlight the word being read

`createTikTokStyleCaptions` groups the word track into pages, and each page renders its tokens with the currently-active one in a different colour:

```tsx
const startRelativeToPage = token.fromMs - page.startMs;
const active = startRelativeToPage <= timeInMs && token.toMs > timeInMs;
<span style={{ color: active ? BRAND.lime : BRAND.white }}>{token.text}</span>
```

A text stroke behind the fill (`paintOrder: "stroke"`) keeps it legible over any frame. That, plus uppercase and a 900 font weight, is the entire "TikTok caption" aesthetic.

## Step 4 - Render it

Three commands cover everything, and you should use all three in that order:

```bash
npm run dev                       # Remotion Studio: live preview, hot reload
npx remotion render Reel out/reel.mp4 --props=src/generated/my-post.json
npx remotion still  Reel out/poster.png --props=... --frame=210
```

Studio is the single most valuable thing in this whole stack. You get a real timeline, a real video element and instant feedback on animation curves, and it would have taken me five times as long to build any of this without it.

`still` matters more than it looks. Rendering one frame is ~8 seconds versus ~30 for the full video, so it is the right way to check a layout tweak.

### Shell out to the CLI, do not use the SSR APIs

Remotion also exposes `@remotion/bundler` and `@remotion/renderer` for Node, which is the "proper" programmatic path. I deliberately did **not** use it, and the docs say why:

> If you have a webpack override in `remotion.config.ts`, pass it here as well.

The Code Hike setup needs exactly such an override (an alias to `@code-hike/lighter`'s ESM build). The CLI reads `remotion.config.ts` automatically; the Node API does not, so you have to keep the two in sync by hand. Shelling out to `remotion render` inherits the CLI's config, its browser management *and* its retry behaviour for free. If your build config is non-trivial, the CLI is the more robust API.

## Step 5 - One command per article

Wrap the two halves into a script so you never think about props files again:

```bash
node scripts/render-reel.mjs --slug my-post           # props + render
node scripts/render-reel.mjs --latest                 # newest by pubDate
node scripts/render-reel.mjs --all                    # every article
node scripts/render-reel.mjs --latest --duration 8     # an 8s teaser
node scripts/render-reel.mjs --latest --max-seconds 20 # cap the reel length
```

It rebuilds props from Markdown first, so a single command always renders the current state of the article. `--max-seconds` is what turns "a video" into "a short": the scene planner stops adding sections once the budget is spent.

### Make it idempotent

Before wiring up automation, add a way to ask *what still needs doing*:

```js
// scripts/list-missing-reels.mjs
for (const slug of await listArticles()) {
  if (!fs.existsSync(reelPath(slug))) entries.push(slug);   // no reel yet
}
entries.sort((a, b) => b.published - a.published);          // newest first
```

This one small script is what makes the CI job safe. Rendering is the slow, expensive, failure-prone part, and "which posts don't have a reel" is a question that is always answerable from the filesystem. A commit diff is not: it breaks on re-runs, on rebases, and on failed renders. Sorting newest-first means a fresh post always wins the next available slot.

## Step 6 - Automate it on publish

Here is the trap that cost me the most time, and it is specific to how a lot of blogs publish.

I already [automate LinkedIn cross-posting](/blog/automate-linkedin-posts-github-actions/) from this same repo, which is how I recognised the shape of the problem immediately - and I still lost an hour to it anyway.

Many repos publish scheduled posts from a GitHub Action, which means the publish commit is pushed with the automatic `GITHUB_TOKEN`. **`GITHUB_TOKEN` pushes do not trigger other workflows.** This is documented by GitHub and it is deliberate, to stop recursive workflow loops. The consequence is that a reel workflow triggered by `push` would take one look at your daily scheduled publish and do absolutely nothing, forever, silently.

So the workflow needs two automatic triggers, not one:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['src/content/blog/**']
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Schedule post publishing"]   # <- the one that actually fires
    types: [completed]
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      slug: { required: false }
      max:  { required: false, default: "5" }
      force: { required: false, type: boolean, default: false }
```

The `push` trigger catches normal commits. The `workflow_run` trigger catches everything the scheduler publishes, because "that workflow finished" is an event the `GITHUB_TOKEN` restriction does not apply to. Both paths then run the *same* job, which asks *list-missing-reels* what to do. One code path, three ways in.

```yaml
- name: Work out which articles need a reel
  run: node scripts/list-missing-reels.mjs --limit "${MAX_REELS:-3}" > "$RUNNER_TEMP/slugs.txt"

- name: Render reels
  run: |
    while IFS= read -r slug; do
      node scripts/render-reel.mjs --slug "$slug" \
        --out "$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/article-reels/$slug.mp4" || failed=$((failed + 1))
    done < "$RUNNER_TEMP/slugs.txt"
```

A few details that matter in practice:

- **Cap automatic runs** (3 reels). Without a cap, the first run tries to backfill every post you have ever written and burns an hour of runner time. Manual runs pass a bigger `max`.
- **Do not `set -e` the render loop.** One article with a pathological code block should not abandon the other two.
- **Cache the browser.** The Chrome Headless Shell download is ~100 MB; `actions/cache` on `node_modules/.remotion` makes the second run minutes faster.
- **Upload artifacts as well as committing.** Artifacts survive a rejected push, a protected branch, or a race with another workflow.
- **Do not commit with `set -e` semantics you do not want.** The bot's commit is skipped cleanly when nothing changed, using `git diff --cached --quiet`.

## Step 7 - Optional: a paste-a-Markdown GUI

Once `buildReelPropsFromMarkdown({ markdown })` exists as a function, a web UI is about eighty lines of Express. The only part worth calling out is that the GUI should shell out to the same render script rather than reimplementing anything, so the button and the CLI can never disagree:

```js
await spawnRemotion({
  cliArgs: ["render", "Reel", output, `--props=${propsFile}`, "--log=info"],
  onLine: (line) => progress.parse(line),
});
```

Parse Remotion's own stdout for `Rendered 388/520` and you get a real progress bar for free. Queue the jobs and run them one at a time; two Chromes on one small machine is how you find out what an OOM kill looks like.

## The five things that actually broke

This is the section I wish every "here's my pipeline" post had. All five of these produced *silent* or *misleading* failures.

### 1. One arrow character crashed the browser

**Symptom:** the renderer died on frames 604-607. Every time. `Protocol error (Runtime.callFunctionOn): Target closed.` Other frames rendered fine.

**What was happening:** the outro scene drew a `→` (U+2192). The UI font is loaded as the **latin subset** only, which does not contain the arrow, so Chromium fell back to a system font for that one glyph. In a container with no system fonts installed, that fallback path kills the renderer process outright.

**How I found it:** by bisecting. Replacing the arrow with the words "Read more" made those frames render; putting the arrow back re-broke them, reproducibly.

**Fix:** draw symbols as inline SVG instead of text, and audit for risky glyphs at build time. The props builder now scans every string it is about to render and replaces anything outside the font subset with a space, reporting what it replaced:

```text
! my-post: replaced non-Latin glyphs: "→" (U+2192) x2
```

If you take one thing from this article: **an emoji in a headline is a landmine** in a fontless CI container.

### 2. A 64 MB `/dev/shm` killed Chrome mid-render

**Symptom:** `Target closed` at random frames, worse with more parallelism.

**What was happening:** Remotion keeps roughly **8 MB of shared memory per concurrent render tab**. My container mounted a 64 MB `/dev/shm`, so eight tabs was the entire budget, and Remotion happily opens one per core (60, here).

**Fix:** tell Remotion to use file-backed pools instead of POSIX shared memory:

```bash
export REMOTION_SHARED_MEMORY_BACKEND=file
```

The render script now checks the size of `/dev/shm` and sets that automatically when it is under 512 MB. The alternative, lowering `--concurrency`, also works, just slower.

### 3. Syntax-highlighted code rendered black on dark

**Symptom:** code was technically there, and nearly invisible.

**What was happening:** Code Hike's `<Pre>` component renders a plain `<pre>` and does **not** apply the `code.style` that the highlighter hands it. Theme colours are the caller's job. With no explicit colour, the text inherited the document default.

**Fix:** pass the colour explicitly from the theme:

```tsx
style={{ color: themeColors.editor.foreground, background: "transparent" }}
```

### 4. Every download 404'd, and the logs said nothing

**Symptom:** the GUI rendered videos correctly, then refused to serve them. `NotFoundError: Not Found` from `res.sendFile`.

**What was happening:** Express's underlying `send` refuses paths containing a dot-directory. My scratch space was `server/.work/<id>/`, so a valid, existing, correctly-permissioned file was unservable purely because a parent folder started with a dot.

**Fix:** rename it (`server/work/`), and pass `{ dotfiles: "allow" }` as a belt-and-braces guard.

### 5. One caption page ate the entire video

**Symptom:** instead of 3-4 words at a time, the caption bar showed a 20-second wall of text.

**What was happening:** `createTikTokStyleCaptions` only starts a new page when an incoming token's text **begins with a space** - the convention Whisper output follows. My generated words had no leading spaces, so the grouping logic never saw a boundary.

**Fix:** prefix every word with a space, and mark the last word of each scene with `pageBreakAfter: true` so a page can never bleed across a scene boundary.

## What it costs and what it produces

Measured on a machine with plenty of cores, rendering 1080x1920 H.264:

| Article | Scenes | Reel | Frames | Output | Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux terminal commands | 7 | 23.7s | 710 | 2.2 MB | ~28s |
| Netlify vs Vercel | 8 | 31.0s | 930 | 2.6 MB | ~35s |
| Docker quickstart (pasted) | 5 | 17.3s | 520 | 1.5 MB | 20.1s |

Across all 30 posts in the repo, props generation runs in about 8 seconds *total*; the render is the entire cost. On GitHub's runners a reel lands in 40-70 seconds including the checkout and browser cache restore.

At roughly 2 MB per reel you are adding a couple of megabytes per post to the repo. That is fine for years; if you would rather not, skip the commit step and keep the artifacts.

## FAQ

**Why not just pay for a blog-to-video tool?**

Honestly, if your posts are listicles with no code in them, you probably should. Those tools are faster, need no
maintenance, and will source stock imagery you do not have. Self-hosting wins in three narrower cases: your posts
contain code, your brand is defined in code, or you object to uploading drafts to a third party. Those are also
exactly the cases where a generic tool falls over.

**Do I need a voiceover?** No. The captions are synthesised from the on-screen script, which is why the pipeline works with no audio at all. If you *do* want narration, transcribe it with Whisper, feed the word-level result in as the caption track, and add an `<Audio>` tag.

**Does it work for non-technical posts?** Yes, and better than you would expect, because point scenes and captions do not care what the subject is. You just lose the code scenes, which is the one thing this approach does better than a generic tool.

**Can I avoid committing the MP4s?** Yes. Drop the commit step and keep only `actions/upload-artifact`. You lose the convenience of `article-reels/<slug>.mp4` living in the repo, and you keep the repo small.

**Is Remotion free?** [Remotion is free](https://www.remotion.dev/pricing) for individuals and companies of up to three people. Beyond that it needs a Company License, and cloud rendering has its own terms. If you are deploying this at work, read that page first. It is a real constraint, not a footnote.

**Do I have to run it in CI?** No. `--latest` on a cron or a git hook does the same job. CI is attractive because the runner already has a clean Linux box with fonts and libraries, which - as the section above shows - is not a given in a container.

## Should you self-host your own blog-to-video pipeline?

A generic blog-to-video tool will produce something passable in a minute. This pipeline produces something *better* for a technical post, because it can show your actual code, in your actual brand colours, with captions that read like the article. It also costs nothing per video and never sees a rate limit.

The trade is honest though: it is a weekend of work, and you own the failures. When a render dies at frame 604, nobody is going to fix it for you.

Start smaller than I did. Clone the [Code Hike](https://www.remotion.dev/templates/code-hike) and [TikTok](https://www.remotion.dev/templates/tiktok) templates, get one article rendering locally with `npm run dev`, and only then add the automation. The GitHub Actions half is thirty lines, but it is thirty lines that will happily do nothing at all if you get the trigger wrong.
