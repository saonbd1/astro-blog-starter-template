Ollama can run large language models on your own computer. You do not need a GPU to run it on your pc. And there are no need of any cloud storage. With a small model and a few tweaks on a stable pc, a 4 to 8 GB RAM laptop can serve text generation in under a second.

This guide shows the minimum setup that works on low spec hardware.

## What You Need

- Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit
- Minimum 4 GB of RAM Recommended 8 GB
- About 5 GB of free disk space

## Step 1: Install Ollama

[Download the Windows installer from the Ollama website](https://ollama.com/download/OllamaSetup.exe). Run the file. Accept the defaults. Ollama starts as a background service and listens on port `11434`.

## Step 2: Pick a Small Model

Large models need more RAM than a weak PC has. Pick a model that fits your memory.

### For 4 GB of free RAM, use the smallest tier like tinnyllama:

```
ollama pull tinyllama
```

### For 6 to 8 GB of free RAM, use a balanced tier like phi3 mini

```
ollama pull phi3:mini
```

### For 8 GB or more of free RAM, use a stronger tier from below:

#### LLAMA 3.2: 1b or 3b

```
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
```
#### Deepseek R1 is Fine 

```
ollama pull deepseek-r1:8b
```
#### Gemma4 e2b 

```
ollama run gemma4:e2b
```

The first pull downloads the weights. A small model is about 600 MB. A larger model is about 2 GB.

## Step 3: Run the Model

Open PowerShell with Admin From Start Menu. Start a chat session:

```
ollama run tinyllama
```

Type any question. Press Enter. Wait for the reply. The first reply takes longer because the model loads into memory.

To stop the session, type `/bye`.

## Step 4: Set The AI Lower Memory Use 

These settings reduce RAM usage on a low config pc. Open PowerShell as admin and run the commands before you start the model.

### Set the number of layers the GPU can load. Zero means the CPU does all the work:

```
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("OLLAMA_NUM_GPU", "0", "User")
```

### Set the number of CPU threads. Choose how many physical cores it use:

```
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("OLLAMA_NUM_THREADS", "4", "User")
```

### Set the AI model context size. A smaller context uses less memory:

```
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("OLLAMA_NUM_CTX", "512", "User")
```

Restart PowerShell so the new settings take effect.

## Step 5: Talk to the API

Ollama serves a local HTTP API on port `11434`. Send a prompt from any tool like command prompts, powershell or any others that can make an HTTP request.

Example with `curl`:

```
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "tinyllama",
  "prompt": "Explain HTTP in one sentence.",
  "stream": false
}'
```

The response is JSON. The text is in the `response` field.

## Step 6: Stop the AI Service Running in Background

Ollama runs in the background. To free the RAM, stop the service from PowerShell as admin:

```
Stop-Service -Name "Ollama"
```

Start it again later with:

```
Start-Service -Name "Ollama"
```

## Troubleshooting Errors

### The AI model is running slow

Close every other program that uses RAM. A guide on how to [Cleanup your windows 11 pc and make it faster](https://www.techtips.fun/blog/how-to-repair-corrupted-windows-11-system-files-sfc-dism/)

### PowerShell reports `ollama` is not recognized

Open a new PowerShell window. The installer adds Ollama to the PATH for new sessions only.

### The model stops mid-sentence

The process ran out of memory. Pick a smaller model. Lower `OLLAMA_NUM_CTX` to `256`.

### Port `11434` is in use

Another program uses the port. Stop the program, or set a different port before you start Ollama:

```
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("OLLAMA_HOST", "127.0.0.1:11435", "User")
```

## A Note on Battery Life

Running a model on the CPU drains a laptop battery fast. Plug in the charger before you start a long session. Keep in mind, the cooling fan run louder than usual.

## What to Try Next

- Add a web UI such as Open WebUI for a chat interface
- Write a small script that calls the API for a specific task
- Swap the model for a larger one when you upgrade the RAM

That's all for today. I will be back with something new and interesting for you. Take care.
