Meta released **Muse Glimmer** on August 10, 2026. It is a 30-billion-parameter open-weight model for local AI agents. It focuses on tool use, long tasks, coding, image input, and failure recovery. It runs on a Mac or PC with suitable memory and a compatible runtime.

This guide explains what Muse Glimmer does, what hardware it needs, and how to choose a local setup. It also explains where the model performs well and where you need to use caution.

### What is Muse Glimmer AI?

Muse Glimmer is a dense causal language model with a dedicated perception encoder. The perception encoder lets the model read text and images in the same task. This supports screenshot analysis, chart reading, document review, and visual agent workflows.

The model is built for agents, not only chat. An agent can plan a task, call a tool, read the result, and continue. Muse Glimmer also supports failure recovery. If a tool call returns an error, the model can diagnose the result and try again.

Meta released the model weights under the **Apache 2.0 license**. The weights are available through Hugging Face. The model card describes commercial and research use, subject to the license and usage policy. Read the license and usage policy before you deploy the model in a product.

## Features of Muse Glimmer 30B in nutshell:

- This model size is about 29.6 billion parameters
- Model type is Dense causal transformer with a perception encoder 
- Context size 131,072 tokens or more, according to the model card
- The model is licensed under Apache 2.0
- The Main focus area is local agents, coding, tool use, and multimodal tasks
- Reasoning control ability is Low, medium, high, and xhigh
- Deployment is available on local hardware, servers, and supported inference runtimes


## What can Muse Glimmer do?

Muse Glimmer targets several tasks that need more than a single answer. It can write and debug code, call tools, inspect images, and continue a long task. Meta also lists synthetic data generation and model evaluation as intended uses.

The strongest use case is a local agent with a clear task boundary. For example, the agent can inspect a project folder, identify a code error, edit selected files, run tests, and report the result. The agent harness controls the file access and tool permissions.

The model also supports visual work. You can give it a screenshot, chart, or document with a text instruction. The model can then describe the image or use the image as part of a larger task. Video is not a native output or video reasoning workflow. The model card states that video input is processed as individual frames.

## What hardware does Muse Glimmer need?

Hardware depends on the model format. Full-precision BF16 weights need much more memory than a quantized build. Meta states that 4-bit quantization reduces the language model weights to under 20 GB. The complete local stack also needs memory for the KV cache, the perception encoder, and the optional DFlash drafter.

Public setup guidance from Unsloth lists about 17 GB for a 4-bit build, 20–22 GB for a 6-bit build, and 34 GB for an 8-bit build. It lists about 58 GB for BF16. These numbers are guidance for specific builds. Your real need changes with context length, runtime, operating system, and other processes. 

A laptop with 8 GB or 16 GB of memory is not a good target for a complete Muse Glimmer setup. Partial offload can make a model load, but it can reduce speed. Treat model loading and useful performance as separate goals.


## How to run Muse Glimmer locally

The simplest setup depends on your operating system and your goal. A desktop app is useful for a first test. A command-line runtime gives you more control. A server runtime is useful when an agent or application needs an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

### Option 1: Use a desktop app

LM Studio and Unsloth provide desktop paths for local model use. Search for Muse Glimmer in the model section. Select a quantized build that fits your memory. Start with a 4-bit build when your system has about 17 GB or more of usable memory.

This path is useful for testing prompts, images, and basic chat. It is less suitable for a production agent until you add permissions, logs, and safety checks.

### Option 2: Use llama.cpp

The GGUF release includes quantized model files. The vision workflow also needs a perception encoder file. The DFlash file is optional and can improve decoding speed.

First, use a llama.cpp version that supports Muse Glimmer. The public GGUF model page states that build `b10353` or newer is required.

Then download a text model and the perception encoder. A typical server command uses the following pattern:

```bash
./build/bin/llama-server \\
  -m Muse-Glimmer-30B-GGUF/muse-glimmer-30B-kquant-17gb.gguf \\
  --mmproj Muse-Glimmer-30B-GGUF/mmproj-kquant.gguf \\
  -ngl 99 \\
  --jinja \\
  --temp 1.0 \\
  --top-p 0.95 \\
  --top-k 64
```

Use the exact file names from the model page. Keep `--jinja` enabled for the chat template. Start with a smaller context length during testing. Increase it after you confirm that the server fits in memory.

### Option 3: Use Ollama or vLLM

Ollama is a convenient choice for a local command-line workflow. The GGUF model page lists an Ollama path for the model. vLLM is a better fit for a service that needs an OpenAI-compatible API and concurrent requests.

Check that the runtime supports the model format and the quantization before you download several gigabytes of files. Runtime support can change quickly after a new model release, and quantization reduces the precision of model weights and lowers memory use. It can also enhance the quality. A higher-bit format usually needs more memory but can preserve more quality.

## Tips for your local build

- Start with a 4-bit build if you want a balance between memory and quality.
- Choose a smaller build when your system cannot fit the 4-bit model.
- Choose BF16 when you have enough memory and prefer a full-precision base for research or fine-tuning.

Do not compare quantization names alone. Compare the total memory needed, context length, vision files, and runtime overhead. A model file that fits on disk can still fail during generation because the KV cache also needs memory.

## How good is Muse Glimmer for coding and agents?

Meta reports strong results for Muse Glimmer in agentic and coding benchmarks. Its published results include **51.2 on SWE-Bench Pro**, **76.0 on SWE-Bench Verified**, and **51.7 on TerminalBench 2.1**. These are vendor-reported results.

The results do not make Muse Glimmer the best ai model for every task. Meta’s table shows Qwen3.6-27B ahead on several benchmarks, including SWE-Bench Verified, TerminalBench 2.1, and OSWorld-Verified. A good comparison must use the task that matters to you.

## Why Muse Glimmer is a good candidate and What to test 

- Local coding agent: Coding, tool calls, and failure recovery. Test edits, tests, and multi-file changes
- Screenshot analysis: Native text and image input. Test small text and complex layouts
- Private document work: Local execution keeps files on your machine. Test access controls and prompt injection
- Long-running workflow: Long context and persistent agent scaffolds. Test recovery after tool errors
- Production API vLLM and other server paths exist. Test concurrency, latency, and logging 

## Why does local AI matter?

Cloud models send prompts and files to a remote service. A local model runs on hardware that you control. This can help when a task uses private code, internal documents, or personal files.

Local inference also removes a per-token API bill for each request. It does not make AI free. You still pay for hardware, power, storage, maintenance, and setup time. Local inference also does not remove security risks. An agent can still follow a malicious instruction in a document or call a tool with too much access.

Use a permission limit for every tool. Add human approval for actions that delete files, send messages, move money, or change production systems.

## Muse Glimmer compared with other local models

Muse Glimmer belongs to a growing group of open-weight models that target local inference. Gemma and Qwen are the closest comparisons in Meta’s published benchmark table. GPT-OSS is another useful comparison when license and local deployment matter.

Muse Glimmer has three clear differences. It is dense, it includes a perception encoder, and it targets a 24 GB or 32 GB local hardware envelope through quantization. These design choices can make it attractive for private agent tasks that need image input.

Qwen can lead on several reported coding and multimodal benchmarks. Gemma can lead on selected general reasoning benchmarks. The best choice depends on your task, hardware, language needs, and license requirements.

Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Muse Glimmer free?

The downloadable model weights do not have a per-token Meta API price. You can download the weights under the Apache 2.0 license, subject to the model’s usage policy. You still need suitable hardware or a paid hosted service. Hosting costs can include compute, storage, bandwidth, and operations.

### Is Muse Glimmer safe for production?

Do not treat the model as a complete production system. Meta recommends additional safeguards for systems that use tools. The model can make errors, follow unsafe instructions, or produce incorrect output. Local execution protects the data path from a cloud endpoint, but it does not solve prompt injection or excessive permissions.

Use a sandbox for code execution. Give each tool the smallest permission that it needs. Log tool calls and results. Require human approval for irreversible actions. Test the complete agent system with data from your real workflow before deployment.

## Last thinking 

Muse Glimmer AI is a strong option for developers who want a local, multimodal agent model. It is most useful when the workflow needs code, tools, long tasks, or image input.
